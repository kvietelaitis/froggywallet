## prerequisites

this project is based on go (backend), react (frontend) and docker (database). 

### docker setup

- **windows**:

    check system requirements for docker desktop, specifically the part about wsl 2, as docker desktop uses it.
    
    download docker from the official link (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) . run the installer and follow the instructions.
    
    to verify the installation, open the powershell / windows terminal and run:
    
    | docker --version |
    | docker compose version |
